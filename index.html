I enjoy growing and studying cacti,   as part of a general interest in nature. Besides plants I also have a big interest in animals, basicaly as long as it breathes air or CO2 and has a unique survival strategy it sparks my interest.

I've also spent a great deal of time imagining and cconstructing stories and the people that live in them, not necessarily in writing, but in visuals, like drawings of characters, landscapes, buildings and tools, this is also something i'd like to do for a living in the future.
